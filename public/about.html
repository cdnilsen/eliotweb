<p style="padding-left:100px; padding-right:100px; padding-top:50px;"><i>Eliotweb</i> is a site-in-progress for browsing the text of the Massachusett-language Eliot Bible, along with Experience Mayhew's 1709 translation of the Psalms and Gospel of John; eventually, I also intend to add the texts of various secondary missionary texts and sermons. <b>It is still a work in progress and will be for some time</b>. Many Old Testament books are still awaiting copies, and very little proofreading of any section of the text has been done so far. <span style="color: red">Nothing should be cited without consulting scans of original copies.</span></p>

<p style="padding-left:100px; padding-right:100px">There are a number of people to whom this site owes a considerable debt: Roger Higgins, who saved me a great deal of time and effort two decades ago by making copies of the second-edition Pentateuch, Joshua, Ruth, New Testament, and second book of Kings; Ives Goddard, David Costa, and Will Oxford, for their considerable body of knowledge and endless willingness to answer questions; and Brennan Colberg, Wesley Rian and Cazim Hysi for their programming expertise.</p>
