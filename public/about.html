<p><i>Eliotweb</i> is a site-in-progress for browsing the text of the Massachusett-language Eliot Bible, along with Experience Mayhew's 1709 translation of the Psalms and Gospel of John; eventually, I also intend to add the texts of various secondary missionary texts and sermons. <b>It is still a work in progress</b>. Many Old Testament books are still awaiting copies, and very little proofreading of any section of the text has been done so far. <span style="color: red">Nothing should be cited without consulting scans of original copies.</span></p>

<p>There are a number of people to whom this site owes a considerable debt: Ives Goddard and David Costa for their considerable body of knowledge and willingness to answer questions; Wesley Rian and Cazim Hysi for their programming expertise; and Drew Bennett and James Bertrand for their ongoing feedback on the site's structure.</p>
