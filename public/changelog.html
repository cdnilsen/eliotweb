    <p>2/22/24:
        <ul class="normal">
            <li>Connected site to www.eliotweb.net.</li>
            <li>Fixed some bugs that had been bedevilling the word searches, which should now work. Clicking on a verse cite in the English-language search should bring up a box with the text of the KJV even if no Massachusett has been copied yet.</li>
            <li>Added the text of the KJV's James, 2 Peter and 1 John, which had been overlooked.</li>
            <li>Added an 'about' page.</li>
            <li>Added the changelog page.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>2/23/24:
        <ul class="normal">
            <li>Added superscriptions to Mayhew's and KJV Psalms. The verse counts are off by one in those psalms for now.</li>
            <li>Refactored quite a bit in the backend and started populating the word-per-edition tables.</li>
            <li></li>
