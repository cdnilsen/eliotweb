    <p>2/22/24:
        <ul class="normal">
            <li>Connected site to www.eliotweb.net.</li>
            <li>Fixed some bugs that had been bedevilling the word searches, which should now work. Clicking on a verse cite in the English-language search should bring up a box with the text of the KJV even if no Massachusett has been copied yet.</li>
            <li>Added the text of the KJV's James, 2 Peter and 1 John, which had been overlooked.</li>
            <li>Added an 'about' page.</li>
            <li>Added the changelog page.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>2/23/24:
        <ul class="normal">
            <li>Added superscriptions to Mayhew's and the KJV Psalms. Superscriptions are given as 'verse zero'.</li>
            <li>Started populating the word-per-edition tables (no effect on the search engines as of yet).</li>       
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>2/24/24:
        <ul class="normal">
            <li>Fixed a bug in the Massachusett word search where adjacent verses in the list were sometimes grabbing the same text.</li>
            <li>Implemented a minor cosmetic fix with word-highlight so that highlighting does not also apply to punctuation at the end of the word (so a search for <i>wosketomp</i> will highlight <b><span style="color: red">wosketomp</span>,</b> rather than <b><span style="color: red">wosketomp,</span></b>).</li>
        </ul>
